# malmax

This package was originally developed by the authors of "MalMax: Multi-Aspect Execution for Automated Dynamic Web Server Malware Analysis" which was presented at the ACM CCS conference: https://sdg.cs.virginia.edu/publication/malmax-malware-analysis-ccs-2019/

We have made numerous modifications to the original version to operate based on Symbolic variables, run distributed analysis, perform forced execution, and added new PHP features (e.g., PHP 7.4 new language feature support).
